# Visualizing Element Concentrations with Pyplot

This code, draw.py, is a quick way to show where
elements are concentrated over time. The time series
is represented as unique drawings (animation coming soon).
The x-axis is broken into bins of locations. The y-axis
is broken into groups that contain each element. The
number of elements within a group that occupies a given
location relates to the size of the scatter plot marker
in that spot on the chart.

## Todo

This code is a hack. The locations.csv is a very simple
sample dataset.
